    <!-- Theme applied to the Android Window while the process is starting when the OS has decided
         to display the app. This theme determines the colors of the window background, etc; it is
         expected to be replaced by the normal theme soon (as soon as the Flutter platform has
         determined the app's brightness and main colors while the app initializes).
         This theme is only used at cold start when running the app with a release (--release)
         Flutter build. It is assumed that the app will never be started with a --profile or
         --debug build when a previous release build was the last app in the stack. -->
